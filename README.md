# :pencil2: Read a CSV
This repository: a small piece of code that reads a CSV file and plot it in charts(made by R) and print all the data frame at the end of the program. 

At the end of the code use GGPLOT to plot a better chart.

> Plot:
>
> ![plot](/images/plot.PNG)

> CSV printed:
>
> ![print csv](/images/printPlot.PNG)

#### :fire: Want to use

Use your only CSV to test it or use the CSV in this repository.

> Note: You have only to change the filename here:
> 
> df <- read.csv(**"./csv_name.csv"**, header=T, sep=",")

## :collision: GGPLOT 

The result of GGPLOT:

> ![ggplot used](/images/ggplot.PNG)

:bookmark_tabs: I made this repository to test how to read a CSV file in R. Maybe it helps you.
